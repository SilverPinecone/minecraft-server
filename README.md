# A Very Average 1.16.5 Server
One day this could be great
## Why does this exist
I have made this so that anyone can copy this all to their desktop and make their own changes to the server, if you do want to make a change (like adding a plugin or change a setting) then see the 'I want to be helpful' subheader.
## Before Reading Further!!
This collection of server files does not include the actual 'paper' file used to run the server, the file required can be downloaded below

Paper Download Link : https://papermc.io/downloads#Paper-1.16

The default port is set to *25567*, as such if you were to connect to this using the 'Direct Connect' feature in Minecraft you would need to write

'''bash
localhost:25567
'''

## I want to be helpful
So you've had it this far huh.

If you want to make a large change AKA changes to server.properties or anything you deem quite important then open an issue first

If you have tested the change and it all seems to work then you can add a pull request

## Installation

This should be applicable for both windows and mac

1. Create a file on your desktop for the minecraft server
2. Download the repository by clicking the green 'Code" button at the top of the page and 'Download ZIP'
3. Copy the zip contents into the folder you have just created
4. Download the paper.jar file as mentioned above
5. Copy the new paper.jar file into the same folder
6. If your current java version isnt archaeic then you should be able to double click the paper.jar and it will come to life!
7. *More specific details need to be added*
